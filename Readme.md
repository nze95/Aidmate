~OUR INSPIRATION Millions of people with disabilities are having a hard time overcoming their challenges, be it handling their daily life tasks or obtaining equal career opportunities in the global job market. According to the reputable statistical data that we collected, In developing countries, 80-90% of people with disabilities of working age are unemployed. In the majority of developed countries, the official unemployment rate for people with impairments of working age is at least twice that for those who have no disability. So, we thought of coming up with an admirable piece of technology for disabled individuals that are easier to use than ever before and has a significant influence on their lives.

~WHAT IT DOES "AidMate" features to assist in making personal and professional life significantly easier. The features incorporated are: After a unique user login--

It provides recommendations based on disability conditions and thus enables the users to engage with and learn daily life hacks in unique ways making them more independent to easily handle their activities/chores. It helps users with limited mobility to shop online, they can now order medical supplies and have them delivered directly to their door. It highlights job openings available to potential candidates based on the disability mentioned. Also, we have integrated a text-to-speech feature into our application so that users with vision disabilities can find themselves some ease.

~HOW WE BUILT IT We began by creating a minimalistic user interface (UI) especially targeting the major issues that the users struggle with and later worked on dart and flutter to create the application, we linked each medical item to their respective shopping site and personalized daily life hack videos to YouTube, we also integrated MS Azure Cloud Service to enable the text-to-speech feature.

~CHALLENGES THAT WE OVERCAME We had a hard time coming up with solutions that could cater to the actual needs of the disabled population without making them feel any less than ordinary individuals.

~ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF We are proud that we now understand how to work with APIs as they are vital tools for businesses in all industries and we are glad that we were able to assemble a solution to assist the disabled population and manage our features to work quickly and on schedule.
